2(a)
Due to a change in '< 10' to '<= 10', the for loop runs one extra cycle until i = 10. Therefore, there is an additional output of 'i = 10 squared = 100'.

2(b)
All output is shown in one line.

2(c)
i's increments increase by 2 instead of 1, which also changes the squared outcomes, as well as the number of outputs.

2(d)
Error: expected primary-expression before ')' token
Explanation: the 'less than' symbol must be followed by an argument before the closing bracket. (eg. a value, a variable, or =, etc.)

2(e)
Error: expected a ';'
Explanation: (Almost) Every line of C++ code should end with a semi-colon. In this case it should've ended with a semi-colon, but didn't.

2(f)
Error: ' iostream: no such file of directory'
Explanation: Everything included in the brackets are searched for a as a directory. iostream with a space in front of it doesn't exist.
